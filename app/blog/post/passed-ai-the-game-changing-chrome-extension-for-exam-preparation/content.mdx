## Introduction

Exam preparation is a critical phase in a student's academic journey. It requires dedication, focus, and the right strategies to ensure success. However, traditional exam preparation methods often fall short in providing personalized support, targeted practice, and actionable feedback. Passed.AI, a cutting-edge Chrome extension, aims to bridge this gap by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way students prepare for exams.

## The Challenges of Exam Preparation

### 2.1. Information Overload and Study Material Abundance

One of the biggest challenges students face during exam preparation is information overload. With the vast amount of study material available online and in textbooks, it can be overwhelming to determine what is relevant and essential for the exam. Students often find themselves drowning in a sea of information, struggling to identify the key concepts and topics they need to focus on.

### 2.2. Lack of Personalized Practice and Feedback

Another significant challenge is the lack of personalized practice and feedback. Traditional study methods, such as reading textbooks and solving generic practice problems, often fail to address individual learning needs and knowledge gaps. Without targeted practice and immediate feedback, students may struggle to identify their strengths and weaknesses, leading to inefficient exam preparation.

### 2.3. Time Management and Study Strategy Difficulties

Effective time management and study strategy planning are crucial for successful exam preparation. However, many students find it challenging to create a structured study plan that balances their time effectively across different subjects and topics. They may struggle to prioritize tasks, allocate sufficient time for practice and revision, and develop effective study techniques that suit their learning style.

## Key Features of Passed.AI
