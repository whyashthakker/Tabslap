Computer vision techniques are employed to generate and manipulate visual representations. These techniques enable the models to synthesize realistic images by understanding the spatial relationships, textures, and compositions of visual elements.

#### 2.2.3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs have revolutionized the field of image generation. They consist of two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—that compete against each other. The generator learns to create realistic images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images. This adversarial training process results in the generation of highly detailed and realistic visuals.

### 2.3. Training Data and Models

To achieve impressive results, AI text-to-image generation models require vast amounts of training data. These models are trained on large datasets that contain paired text-image examples, allowing them to learn the intricate relationships between words and visual representations. The quality and diversity of the training data significantly impact the models' ability to generate accurate and detailed images.
