## Introduction

Online exams have become an integral part of the modern education landscape, offering flexibility and accessibility to students worldwide. However, the transition from traditional in-person exams to online assessments has brought forth new challenges and concerns. Exam Room AI, an innovative Chrome extension, addresses these challenges head-on by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to create a secure, efficient, and intellectually engaging online exam environment.

## The Challenges of Online Exams

### 2.1. Academic Integrity Concerns

One of the primary concerns surrounding online exams is the potential for cheating and academic dishonesty. Without the physical presence of invigilators, students may be tempted to resort to unauthorized resources or collaborate with others during the exam. This compromises the integrity of the assessment and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process.

### 2.2. Technical Difficulties and Compatibility Issues

Online exams often rely on various technologies and platforms, which can lead to technical difficulties and compatibility issues. Students may face challenges with internet connectivity, device compatibility, or software requirements, causing frustration and hindering their ability to complete the exam smoothly.

### 2.3. Lack of Personalized Support

In traditional exam settings, students have the opportunity to seek clarification or assistance from invigilators or educators. However, in online exams, this personal interaction is often lacking, leaving students to navigate the exam on their own without immediate support or guidance.

## Key Features of Exam Room AI

### 3.1. Secure Exam Environment

Exam Room AI creates a secure and controlled exam environment within the Chrome browser. It prevents students from accessing unauthorized websites, applications, or resources during the exam, ensuring the integrity of the assessment.
